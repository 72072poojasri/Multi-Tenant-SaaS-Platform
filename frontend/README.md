Getting Started with a React Application
This project was initialized using Create React App, a popular tool for setting up React applications with minimal configuration.

Available Commands
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Runs the application in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
Any linting or runtime errors will be displayed in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
It continuously watches for changes and re-runs tests automatically.

More information is available in the Running Tests section of the documentation.

npm run build
Builds the application for production and outputs the files into the build folder.

The production build:

Is optimized for performance

Uses minified code

Includes hashed filenames

After the build is complete, the application is ready for deployment.

npm run eject
⚠️ Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back.

If you want full control over the configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject the project.

This command will:

Remove Create React App as a dependency

Copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project

All commands except eject will continue to work, but you will be responsible for managing the configuration.

You do not need to eject for most projects. The default configuration works well for small and medium-scale applications.
